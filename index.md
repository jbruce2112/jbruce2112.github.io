Hi, I'm John. I'm a software engineer from Michigan. I love creating great software in C++, and more recently, Swift. Here are some of the things I've been working on lately.

[Cutlines](https://cutlines.jbruce.me) - A univerisal iOS app for adding captions to photos.

[Music Mate](https://github.com/jbruce2112/music-mate) - A macOS app that fetches music feature data from Spotify.

You can find more of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbruce2112).
