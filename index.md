I'm an iOS Developer at Expedia in San Francisco. I love building apps that are focused on making users happy, and pride myself in writing clean, highly testable code.

Here are some of the things I've been working on lately.

[Transit Times](https://github.com/jbruce2112/transit-times) - A watchOS app for quickly viewing Muni arrival information for stops.

[Cutlines](https://cutlines.jbruce.me) - A universal iOS app for adding captions to photos.

[Music Mate](https://github.com/jbruce2112/music-mate) - A macOS app that fetches music feature data from Spotify.

You can find more of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbruce2112).
